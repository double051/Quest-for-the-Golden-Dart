Dart Hackathon Seattle 2012

Dart -> JS in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer (bugs in Opera)

Looks like C and JS had a baby (Dart!)
JSON is valid Dart syntax
String interpolation with ${variable}
Closures and nested functions
Collections have forEach, map, filter
Fat arrow syntax (=>)
Imperative language with function
solid lexical scoping

classes, data types, encapsulation
Javascript prototype syntax is busted and opaque
Dart makes classes and types nice
solid lexical scope, no more 'this.stuff'
